      "htmlBody": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Running a business blog is not easy. Not only does blogging require time and discipline to produce content, but it also feels far less tangible compared to conversion-driven sales strategies such as digital advertising or social media. Conversions from content marketing are difficult to track and have significant lag time. Why then, do companies like</span><a href=\"https://blog.airtable.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.airtable.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">Airtable</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">,</span><a href=\"https://blog.trello.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.trello.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">Trello</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">,</span><a href=\"https://journal.mejuri.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </a><a href=\"https://journal.mejuri.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">Mejuri</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">, and</span><a href=\"https://slackhq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </a><a href=\"https://slackhq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">Slack</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> take the time to produce content and maintain traffic driven to their company blogs?</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The key to understanding the value of content marketing is to distinguish </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">marketing</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> from </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">sales</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">. While paid Facebook advertisements, bids in Google AdWords, and Mailchimp campaigns are direct actions with clear measurements like revenue conversion and click-through rates, content marketing is a step (or several) removed from the act of selling.&nbsp;But just because content marketing hard to quantify doesn't mean you should neglect it. In the long run, creating and distributing content is a great way to own a direct relationship with your customer.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">You’ve probably heard the saying: “People love to buy, but hate to be sold.” Author and “King of Sales” Jeffrey Gitomer dives into the statement in his own</span><a href=\"https://go.gitomer.com/blog/people-dont-like-to-be-sold-but-they-love-to-buy\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </a><a href=\"https://go.gitomer.com/blog/people-dont-like-to-be-sold-but-they-love-to-buy\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">blog post</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">. The key takeaway is that businesses should focus on eliciting an emotional need from customers to spend money on your company’s product or service. Good content marketing speaks directly to the hopes and dreams of your customers through the language of storytelling, like I'm (hopefully) doing right now. This makes it possible to broadcast to both existing customers and potential new ones by building an emotional context around why your product will make their lives better.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">To illustrate the advantages content marketing can have over advertising, let me tell you the story of my recent interaction with TurboTax. Moments after I finally finished filing my 2018 tax returns, I flopped down on my couch and opened the Facebook app on my phone. The first posted that popped up on my screen was a TurboTax ad. I was instantly turned off: how dare TurboTax hound after me like that (ok, maybe paying taxes had put me in a sensitive mood!). What’s funny is that I had already purchased a TurboTax license to file my taxes and was pretty happy with their service. However, I disliked the thought of being manipulated, and sold to in an inelegant, indiscreet way. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Like most people, I like to think I am above digital sales tactics, and that I can make my own informed decisions on what products to buy. While my impulse online shopping habits continue to suggest that I am as much of a puppet as advertisers hope, I increasingly finding myself subtracting points from companies that seem to explicitly try to trap me in their sales shenanigans. And as sponsored posts continue to proliferate across all corners of our lives, this sentiment is becoming true for most consumers: a recent survey showed that </span><a href=\"https://www.marketingweek.com/2017/06/29/arrogance-brand-purpose-distrust-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">70% of all consumers</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> distrust advertising.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Compare my encounter with TurboTax to a recent article they posted on their blog: </span><a href=\"https://blog.turbotax.intuit.com/self-employed/6-tips-to-help-side-hustlers-and-self-employed-bosses-stay-on-top-of-their-taxes-43273/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">6 Tips to Help Side Hustlers and Self-Employed Bosses Stay On Top of Their Taxes</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">. The author lays out a couple of useful tips for how self-employed people can file their taxes and at the end gives a quick plug for how Turbotax can help people implement those tips. While this article may not be relevant to you, it’s hard to feel </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">offended</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> by it like I did by the advertisement. I deliberately sought out this article to read on their blog, and it gave some useful, actionable advice, while at the same time marketing how Turbotax can help with that. This is a much better customer experience than having my Facebook browsing experience be hijacked by an ad.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">This trend towards owned content over paid distribution is sweeping over all industries. Whether your company is B2C or B2B, provides a product or a service, has a stacked sales team or just a single, heavily-caffeinated employee, your company’s brand will benefit from writing and owning truly engaging content. Running your blog will help build trust and recognition towards your business and help alleviate the turnoff when you do hit customers with those paid marketing campaigns.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">In the next section, we’ll discuss some of the specific reasons why maintaining a blog will help your company’s sales in the long run.</span></p>",

Authenticity</u></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">There’s little more powerful than a brand that presents as authentic to its customers. According to the </span><a href=\"http://www.authentic100.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;\">2017 Cohn and Wolfe’s Authentic Brands</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> study, </span><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 21, 22);\">91% of consumers globally indicated that they were willing to reward a brand for its authenticity by making a purchase, investment or an endorsement.. In the U.S., 62% of respondents said that would either purchase or be interested in purchasing from a brand that they viewed as authentic. From the study, companies that graced the top ranks include heartwarming household brands like Crayola, Hallmark, and Burt’s Bees, as well as technology giants Intel, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 21, 22);\">Out of the top 20 companies in the authentic brands ranking, only Rolex did not not sport any blogs associated with their official corporation. I have linked the blogs I found below, noting that some of the motor vehicle brands have blogs based on location (such as Harley Davidson Dallas). </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 21, 22);\">Diving into these company’s blog posts, some companies like Apple and Lego use their blogs as a newsroom display of feature specific content. These companies tend to have an extremely loyal following which anticipates each new product release with vigor. Other companies feature blog articles that are not specific to their core product or service and instead focus on current events, impact, and employees. These companies tend not to have businesses that revolve around major product updates. For example, </span><a href=\"https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/blog/bdp/2019/03/21/visa-celebrates-international-1553190547711.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">here</a><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 21, 22);\"> is Visa’s blog post on March 21, 2019 in honor of International Women’s day. Nestle had a similar blog post found </span><a href=\"https://www.nestle.com/stories/international-womans-day-celebrating-gender-balance\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">here</a><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 21, 22);\">. Posting regular blog content not only engages the audience your company already has, but also proves to newcomers that your company actually cares about its values.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 21, 22);\">However, you don’t have to be a big, established brand to get benefits from authentic content marketing. Antonio Garcia-Martinez, author of </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chaos-Monkeys-Obscene-Fortune-Failure/dp/0062458191\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">Chaos Monkeys</a><span style=\"color: rgb(17, 21, 22);\">, used blogging as a key marketing tool when launching his startup AdGrok.

Education </u></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Keeping up a great blog can also be a great way to educate people further about your company and products. Blogs can be used to help the public get a glimpse of your company culture, your mission and values, as well as specific uses for your product or service. Not only is portraying a strong company culture good for both talent recruitment and investment but it also builds a sense of reliability and fulfillment in the customer for supporting a company that is transparent about its inner workings. Customers like to feel like they are stakeholders in your company and will likely do a brief research dive on your company’s website before committing. Transparency of values is not a difficult thing to implement (if your values are good) and can be highly rewarding for the customer to feel bought-in.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">The famous </span><a href=\"https://jobs.netflix.com/culture\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;\">Netflix culture statement</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> is a 4,443 word mountain of employee culture at their corporation. Save for the ever-so-eager Netflix engineer interviewee and talent heads at competing companies, probably no one has read the entirety of this statement. Yet it gets impressive amounts of press and buzz over whether it’s the ideal company culture, whether it’s too hardcore, whether your CS major niece should apply there for a software engineering internship over Amazon, etc. Having a public culture deck and owning up to it is kind of genius power move that speaks for itself.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><u style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">3. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</u></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Among a wealth of other brand (and sales) benefits your business blog can bring you, SEO is a huge factor.

      "description": " Blogging for your startup is a lot like flossing: something that you know you probably should do, but somehow you just never get around to it. In this guide, we explore ways of making it easier for you to maintain a successful blog.",
      "htmlBody": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Keeping an effective blog is one of the best investments you can make in your startup’s marketing presence (see more in our blog post </span><a href=\"https://blog.blogwise.co/a/2019-03-26-part_i_the_content_marketing_trend_how_blogging_will_help_your_business\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">here</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">). However, it requires your team to create and publish content for the blog on a regular basis or the benefits are muted. This might be fine for big companies that can afford a staff dedicated to content marketing, but if you work at an early-stage startup you probably can’t afford such luxuries. While there are no silver bullets to creating an original voice, your company can adopt a few blogging best practices to help build a great blog. Here is a short guide with a few concise tips on how to produce content that is easy to produce and engaging to read.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"><u>1. Use an editorial calendar to plan out your content into the future</u></strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Publishing content on a schedule is important to building a loyal audience. It allows your readers to anticipate new content and shows that your company is organized. One tool that helps your team post content regularly is an editorial calendar. An editorial calendar is a system that helps you plan out the different blog posts you intend to write over the next couple weeks, with specific deadlines for each post.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Editorial calendars give your team the ability to get an overview of what the content marketing strategy looks like over the planned time period. For example, if you run a subscription coffee delivery startup and would like to launch a series on procuring quality coffee beans, you can use an editorial calendar to decide that in four weeks you will post six times about each of the six farms your company’s beans come from. Then, you would write each of the six headlines, space them evenly throughout the month, assign articles to certain team members, and receive notifications for when each blog is due. Planning the headlines of your blog posts ahead of time will help you diversify topics over a certain series, jot down inspiration posts to write later, and coordinate writing with other contributors.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Finally, planning out your content across time is key to getting maximum SEO benefits from your blogging. Google’s search crawlers categorize your blog into ranking on different queries and keywords based off both the content under your domain, and the popularity of that content. Going back to the coffee bean example, if you want to rank highly for the query “artisanal organic coffee beans,” then the best way to get there is by planning out a content strategy centered around a series of articles about organic coffee. Being consistent in publishing quality content will attract a loyal audience, which will signify quality to search algorithms, resulting in a lasting boost in your rankings.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"><u>2. Delegate!</u></strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Odds are, if you are a founder you’re not also a professional writer. As such, it is important to prevent burnout from one member of your team by delegating different blog posts to different team members.&nbsp;Since it is easiest to write about things you find interesting, using the editorial calendar mentioned above, plan out each member’s blog posts based on their own interests. Writing good content is laborious and challenging: if you try to dump the responsibility of writing content a single person, your whole blog will probably implode (see all the company blogs that started off strong with 4 or 5 posts and then went radio silent).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Having multiple writers means your blog posts will be varied and interesting. But sometimes consolidating the work under one person helps with organization and accountability. If you prefer consistency over variety, recruit an eager high schooler or college student as a staff writer. Most likely they’d do it for little more than the opportunity to have it on their resume. Alternatively, reach out to industry specialists to write guest posts on your blog. With the rising trend of podcast-esque guest rotations, featuring a well-known guest from time to time can provide a great boost to your blog traffic.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"><u>3. Repurpose internal resources</u></strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">If there’s anything I have learned from running a fleet of small businesses, it is that documentation is king. My work at HSA (check out my bio </span><a href=\"https://blog.blogwise.co/a/2019-03-24-blogwise_our_team\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">here</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">) sometimes feels like being octomom - the different companies I help run are in different industries with distinct business models and target customers and each demand constant attention in special ways. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">The great part of keeping a great operations manual is that good internal resources often translate well to good external advice. I happen to have a lengthy internal guide on how to use Airtable as a content management system (CMS). I have similar documentation on the usage of Mixmax, Hubspot, Mailchimp, Hotjar, Moz, etc. and could consolidate that into a blog post about helpful software tools. Same thing applies for technical resources and creating developer guides. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Writing a great blog shouldn’t be as hard as it seems to be when you start out. By using editorial calendars (we have one built into our product at </span><a href=\"http://blogwise.co\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;\">blogwise</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">), delegating writing to different team members to maintain diversity and prevent writer’s burnout, and repurposing internal resources, your company can get to a great start with its content marketing strategy. </span></p>",
